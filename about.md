Overview: I am a young talented, individiual who strives for my best performance in each subject which I participate in. I especially like Maths, Science and History. I go to as school in England, U.K and really want to go to Andorra when I am older. It is only after 20 years of living there though that I would be a citizen there.
I speak English but like Spanish. Thank you for reading my blog.
Gracias,
Senor aft6

### More Information:

I am very happy to help anybody who requires help. I would like to travel the world when I am older and have no ambition to do any extreme sports- skydiving, swimming with sharks etc.
